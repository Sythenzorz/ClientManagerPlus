Client Manager - Web Client Management Tool

Client Manager allows you to manage your web design clients and keep them in the loop at all times. 
With your web design projects directly in the backend of your home website, you can always stay on 
top of things. Client Manager has three major sections; the first, Client Details. A simple section that 
allows you to record your clientâ€™s details. The second, meters to establish the progress of both the overall 
project, and individual tasks, and finally third, an interative screenshot system that allows you to record the 
full progress of the website for both you and your client to see.
